        "Environmental systems involve multiple interacting processes, uncertainties, and potentially conflicting objectives. These dynamics can complicate analyses which focus on a single component of the system, such as an individual pollution source, or a single outcome of interest. In this course, we will adopt a systems approach to environmental quality modeling and management, including applications in air and water pollution control and solid waste management. In particular, we will:\n",

        "3. Analyze environmental system risk and vulnerabilities.\n",
        "4. Determine strategies for managing systems using optimization;\n",
        "5. Identify the  trade-offs  that  result  from  competing  objectives  in  environmental  decision -making; \n",

I will put as many course materials, such as lecture notes and announcements, as possible online, but viewing materials online is not the same as active participation and engagement.

However, I expect students to abide by the [Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity](http://theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/academic-integrity/) in all aspects of this class.  **All work submitted must represent the students' own work and understanding**, whether individually or as a group (depending on the particulars of the assignment). This includes analyses,  code,  software  runs,  and  reports. Engineering as a profession relies upon the honesty and integrity of its practitioners (see *e.g.* the [American Society for Civil Engineers' Code of Ethics](https://www.asce.org/-/media/asce-images-and-files/career-and-growth/ethics/documents/asce-code-ethics.pdf)).\n",

Plagiarism occurs when a writer intentionally misrepresents another's words or ideas (including code!) as their own without acknowledging the source.  **All** external resources which are consulted while working on an assignment should be referenced, including other students and faculty with whom the assignment is discussed. You will never be penalized for consulting an external source for help and referencing it, but plagiarism will result in a zero for that assignment as well as the potential for your case to be passed on for additional disciplinary action.\n",

        "- reference the URL of the service you are using, including the specific date you accessed it;\n",

        "In general, late work will be subjected to a 10% penalty per day, *which can accumulate to 100% of the total grade*. However, sometimes things come up in life. Please reach out *ahead of time* if you have extenuating circumstances (including University-approved absences or illnesses) which would make it difficult for you to submit your work on time.

        "  * Rubrics will be provided for the homeworks as part of the assignments.\n",
