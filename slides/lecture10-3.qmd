# Review and Questions

## Solid Waste Management

- Different types of facilities with different **residual** wastes, which impacts the broader system.
- Model as a **network**,   where we care about the flows between different nodes.
- Becomes a mixed integer program if we can choose not to operate facilities.

# Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

## Certainty and LP

**Certainty** (*e.g.* all parameters and relationships between decision variables and outcomes are known) is a key assumption of linear programming.

But most systems problems aren't actually deterministic.

## Approaches to Decision-Making Under Uncertainty

**A Common Approach**:

1. Solve deterministic problem using best estimates.
2. Stress-test solution with Monte Carlo or include additional safety margins (more on this later).

## Representing Uncertainty in Mathematical Programs

**Alternative**: 

1. Solve a *stochastic* problem for best expected performance (or similar summary statistic).

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
We can represent uncertainty through scenarios and (conditional) sequential events, then rewrite the decision problem.

# Example: Land Allocation 

## Land Allocation/Farmer Problem

A farmer can grow wheat, corn, and sugar beets on 500 ha of land. How much land should they allocate to each crop?

## Key information For Problem

- Planting costs are \$150, \$230, and \$260 per acre for wheat, corn, and sugar beets, respectively.
- The farmer requires 200T of wheat and 240T kg of corn for feed, and excess can be sold for \$170 and \$150 per T, respectively.
- Purchasing crops costs \$40 more than the selling prices.
- Sugar beets are sold at \$36/T up to 6000T, at which point the price drops to \$10 per T.

## Farm Yields

From prior experience, the farmer knows that in an average year, yields are:

- 2.5 T/acre for wheat;
- 3 T/acre per corn;  
- 20T/acre for beets.

## Decision Variables 

***What are the decision variables?***

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Variable | Definition
:----: | :-----
$x_i$ | acres of crop $i$ planted
$y_i$ | T of crop $i$ purchased
$z_i$ | T of crop $i$ sold
:::

One twist: sold beets will be represented by two different $z$-variables ($z_3$ and $z_4$), based on whether we exceed 6000T.

## Deterministic Problem Formulation

$$
\begin{align}
\min_{x, y, z} & \quad 150x_1 + 230 x_2 + 260 x_3 + 238 y_1 + 210 y_2 - 170 z_1 \\
& \qquad -150z_2 - 36z_3 - 10z_4 \\[1ex]
\text{subject to:} \quad & x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \leq 500 \\[0.5ex]
& 2.5 x_1 + y_1 - z_1 \geq 200 \\[0.5ex]
& 3 x_2 + y_2 - z_2 \geq 240 \\[0.5ex]
& z_3 + z_4 \leq 20 x_3 \\[0.5ex]
& z_3 \leq 6000 \\[0.5ex]
& x_i, y_i, z_i \geq 0
\end{align}
$$

## Deterministic Solution


Variable | Wheat | Corn | Beets
:----- | :-----: | :----: | :-----:
Area (acres) | 120 | 80 | 300
Yield (T) | 300 | 240 | 6000 
Sales (T) | 100 | -- | 6000 
Purchased (T) | -- | -- | --

This solution yields a profit of \$118,600.

## What About Uncertainty?

But yields tend to vary from year to year. From prior experience, the historical variability is:

- in a good year, yields can be 20% above average;
- in a bad year, yields can be 20% below average.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
To simplify things, let's assume these yields vary consistently across crops and that each scenario (average, good, bad) has an equal probability of occurrence.
:::

## Stochastic Decision Variables

***What should change about our decision variables?***

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Variable | Definition
:----: | :-----
$x_i$ | acres of crop $i$ planted
$y_{ij}$ | T of crop $i$ purchased in scenario $j$
$z_{ij}$ | T of crop $i$ sold in scenario $j$

:::


## Two-Stage Problems

This is typical of a **two-stage** decision problem:

1. Make an **initial** decision (*e.g.* how much to plant) which must be committed to ahead of knowing the stochastic realization;
2. Make a subsequent **recourse** decision based on the realization (*e.g.* do we have to purchase additional crops?)

## Stochastic Objective

***How can we formulate an objective?***

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
**First choice: what statistic are we trying to optimize?**

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Let's choose the expected value $\mathbb{E}\left[\text{Profit}\right]$.

Other possible choices: quantiles (*robust optimization*) to hedge against worst-case outcomes, variance (to minimize year-on-year fluctuations).

## Probabilities and Scenario Trees

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=55%}
Since we have a discrete (and small) set of possible outcomes, we can use a **scenario tree** to write out the possible outcomes.

## Stochastic Objective

Our new objective becomes:

$$\begin{alignedat}{2}
&\min_{x, y, z} & & \quad 150x_1 + 230x_2 + 260x_3 \\[0.5ex]
& &&\qquad -\frac{1}{3} \left(170z_{11} + 150z_{21} + 36z_{31} + 10z_{41} - 238y_{11} - 210 y_{21}\right) \\[0.5ex]
& &&\qquad -\frac{1}{3} \left(170z_{12} + 150z_{22} + 36z_{32} + 10z_{42} - 238y_{12} - 210 y_{22}\right) \\[0.5ex]
& &&\qquad -\frac{1}{3} \left(170z_{13} + 150z_{23} + 36z_{33} + 10z_{43} - 238y_{13} - 210 y_{23}\right)
\end{alignedat}$$

## Stochastic Contraints

$$\begin{alignedat}{2}
&x_1 + x_2 + x_3 \leq 500 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{blue}3x_1 + y_{11} - z_{11} \geq 200, && \qquad  \color{blue}3.6x_2 + y_{21} - z_{21} \geq 240 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{blue}z_{31} + z_{41} \leq 24x_3, && \qquad \color{blue}z_{31} \leq 6000 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{purple}2.5x_1 + y_{12} - z_{12} \geq 200, && \qquad \color{purple}3x_2 + y_{22} - z_{22} \geq 240 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{purple}z_{32} + z_{42} \leq 20x_3, && \qquad \color{purple}z_{32} \leq 6000 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{red}2x_1 + y_{13} - z_{13} \geq 200, && \qquad \color{red}2.4x_2 + y_{23} - z_{23} \geq 240 \\[0.5ex]
&\color{red}z_{33} + z_{43} \leq 16x_3, && \qquad \color{red}z_{33} \leq 6000 \\[0.5ex]
&x_i, y_i, z_i \geq 0
\end{alignedat}$$


## Stochastic Solution

Variable | Wheat | Corn | Beets
:----- | :-----: | :----: | :-----:
Deterministic Area (acres) | 120 | 80 | 300
Stochastic Area (acres) | 170 | 80 | 250 

How do we interpret the differences?

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
- **Good year**: Won't waste acreage on extra beets (6000T yield in stochastic solution, 7200T for deterministic)
- **Bad year**: Will make less off beets, profits from wheat should help cover extra corn purchase.
:::

# Value of the Stochastic Solution

## Comparing Deterministic and Stochastic Solution

- **Deterministic Solution**: "Expected" Profit (no uncertainty) = \$118,600
- **Stochastic Solution**: $\mathbb{E}[\text{Profit}]$ = \$108,390.

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
***Can we directly compare the deterministic and stochastic solution values that we have obtained so far?***
:::

## Expected Performance of Deterministic Solution

Year | Deterministic Profit | Stochastic Profit
:--- | :----: | :----:
Good | \$148,000 | \$167,000
Average | \$118,600 | \$109,350
Bad | \$56,800 | \$48,820

**Expected Profit from Deterministic Solution *under uncertainty***: \$107,240

## Value of the Stochastic Solution

We can now compare the difference in expected profits *under uncertainty*, which is the fair comparison. 

This is called the **value of the stochastic solution (VSS)**, or sometimes the **expected value of including uncertainty (EVIU)**.

$$\begin{aligned}
VSS &= \mathbb{E}[\text{Stochastic Profit}] - \mathbb{E}[\text{Deterministic Profit}] \\[0.5ex]
&= \$108,390 - \$107,240 \\[0.5ex]
&= \$1,150.
\end{aligned}$$

## Expected Value of Perfect Information

Another relevant quantity, the **expected value of perfect information (EVPI)**, concerns the value associated with better forecasts.

## Expected Value of Perfect Information

If the farmer had perfect foresight and could allocate acreage $x$ accordingly and sell/purchase $z$ and $y$ optimally (versus taking the 1/3-probability stochastic solution),

$$\mathbb{E}[\text{Profits} | \text{perfect information}] = \sum_j p_j \times \text{Profits}_j = \$115,405.$$

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
$$\text{EVPI} = \$115,405 - \$108,390 = \$7,015$$

The EVPI can be interpreted as the amount *the farmer might be willing to pay* for an improved forecast.

# Key Takeaways

## Decision-Making and Uncertainty

- A solution obtained assuming deterministic outcomes might "on paper" yield better anticipated outcomes.
- Common approach is a two-stage optimization framework:
    - Make an initial decision;
    - Recourse based on which scenario is realized.
- Scenario trees help build out the representation of outcomes and probabilities.

## Value of the Stochastic Solution


- Solutions to stochastic problems can produce a better expected outcome than the deterministic solution, but will perform better/worse in any given scenario.
- Value of the stochastic solution quantifies expected improvement in performance.
- Expected value of perfect information: amount you might be willing to pay for improved forecasts.
