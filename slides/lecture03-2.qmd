# Simulating Systems

## What is Simulation?

**Simulation**: evaluating a model to understand how a system might evolve under a particular set of conditions.

Think of simulation as *data generation* (or **generative** modeling).

The model represents a particular data-generating process.


## Why Simulate Systems?

::: {.incremental}
1. System involves complex, nonlinear dynamics that may not be analytically tractable.
2. Setting up and running a real-world experiment is not possible.
3. State depends on prior states or states of nearby locations, so need to iterate over multiple spatial or temporal steps.
4. Need to understand range of system performance across rarely-seen conditions.

## Simulating the Shallow Lake Model

For the shallow lake model

$$X_{t+1} = X_t + a_t + y_t + \frac{X_t^q}{1 + X_t^q} - bX_t, \quad
y_t \sim \text{LogNormal}(\mu, \sigma^2).
$$

we need to simulate because:

1. inflows $a_t, y_t$ can change over time (non-steady state);
2. state $X_{t+1}$ depends on $X_t$.

## Simulating Multiple Objectives

Simulation also facilitates analyses of multiple outcomes of interest, which can involve tradeoffs.

For example:

::: {.incremental}
- **Electric power system**: CO$_2$ emissions and cost;
- **Reservoir operations**: hydropower potential, water supply, flood risk.

# Box Models

## What Is A Box Model?

**Box models** are a common building block of simulation models. 

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=40%}
Box models are all about mass-balance (mass $m$), assume well-mixed within box. 

Can be steady-state $(\dot{m} = 0)$ or not.

## Box Models and Simulation

Many simulation models are built by:

1. Dividing the domain into individual boxes (1-D, 2-D, or 3-D);
2. Starting from initial box:
    1. Simulate change to stock within box;
    2. Obtain outflow as inflow into adjacent boxes;
    3. Move onto next box;
3. If needed (*e.g.* non-steady-state), repeat for each time step.

## Box Model Applications

Some applications of box models include:

- Water balance/hydrologic flow models;
- Climate models (ocean heat/CO$_2$ uptake through "box" layers)
- Airsheds

## Box Model Example: Airsheds

Let's look at a simple steady-state box model of an airshed.


| Variable | Meaning | Units |
|:--------:|:-------:|:------|
| $m$ | mass of some air pollutant | g |
| $C$ | concentration in box | g/m$^3$ |
| $S, D$ | source, deposition rate within the box | g/s |
| $u$  | wind speed | m/s |
| $L, W, H$ | box dimensions | m |

## Selecting Box Dimensions

What is relevant for the box dimensions $L$, $W$, and $H$? Primarily the assumption(s) about mixing.

- Mixing height: is there an atmospheric inversion which limits mixing height?
- Homogeneity of input/output flows and emissions.

## Steady-State Airshed Box Model

Steady-state box &Rightarrow; $\dot{m} = 0$.

\begin{align}
0 &= m_\text{in} - m_\text{out} + S - D \\[0.5em]
&\class{\fragment}{{} = (u WH) C_\text{in} - (u WH) C + S - D } \\[0.5em]
\end{align}

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
Solving for $C$:
$$C = C_{in} + \frac{S-D}{uWH}$$
:::

## Non-Steady State Box Model

Now let's assume some process affecting $m$ depends on time.

For example: let's say we care about an air pollutant which has a first-order decay rate $k$, so $L(t) = -km_\text{box}(t)$.

$$\Rightarrow \dot{m} = m_\text{in} - m_\text{out} + S - km_\text{box}(t)$$

## Non-Steady State Solution

\begin{gather}
&\dot{m} = \frac{d(CV)}{dt} = \overbrace{(u WH) C_\text{in}}^{\text{inflow}} - \overbrace{(u WH) C}^{\text{outflow}} + \overbrace{S - D}^{\text{net emissions}} - \overbrace{kCV}^{\text{mass decay}} \\[0.5em]
&\class{fragment}{{} \frac{dC}{dt} = \underbrace{\frac{u WH}{V} C_\text{in} + \frac{S - D}{V}}_{\Large =P} - \underbrace{\left(\frac{u WH}{V} + k\right)}_{\Large =l} C} \\[0.5em]
&\class{fragment}{{} \frac{dC}{dt} = P - l C}
\end{gather}

## Non-Steady State Solution

\begin{gather}
&\frac{dC}{dt} = P - l C \\[0.5em]
&\class{fragment}{{} \int \frac{dC}{P-lC} = \int dt} \\[0.5em] 
&\class{fragment}{{} -\frac{1}{l} \ln\left(P-lC\right) = t + A} \\[0.5em] 
&\class{fragment}{{} \underbrace{C(0) = C_0}_\text{initial condition} \Rightarrow A = -\frac{1}{l} \ln\left(P-lC_0\right)}
\end{gather}

## Non-Steady State Solution

\begin{gather}
&-\frac{1}{l} \ln\left(P-lC\right) = t - \frac{1}{l} \ln\left(P-lC_0\right) \\[0.5em] 
&\class{fragment}{{} -\frac{1}{l} \ln\left(\frac{P-lC}{P-lC_0}\right) = t} \\[0.5em] 
&\class{fragment}{{} C = -\frac{1}{l} \left(P - e^{-lt}\left(P-lC_0\right)\right)} \\[0.5em] 
&\class{fragment}{{} C(t) = C_0 e^{-lt} + \frac{P}{l}\left(1 - e^{-lt}\right) } 
\end{gather}

## Non-Steady State Solution

$$C(t) = \color{red}C_0 e^{-lt} \color{black}+ \color{blue}\frac{P}{l}\left(1 - e^{-lt}\right)$$

::: {.column width=40%}
- Initial condition is **transient** (decays to zero eventually);
- Concentration converges to a steady-state solution.

## Time-Varying Flows

Can also incorporate more complex in/outflow dynamics:

- stochastic/dynamic in advection (wind speed);
- Inflow/outflow concentrations varying over time

## Multiple Boxes

To make this into a multi-box model, we can string together boxes to account for fluxes between them.

But this lets us account for spatially-heterogeneous flows.

**Example**: Two-box "simple" climate models which model the ocean and atmosphere as separate boxes.

## Resolution/Complexity Tradeoff

More boxes (*higher resolution*) typically allows us to simulate more detailed dynamics.

But each box needs to be resolved in sequence to generate fluxes, so more boxes results in greater computational complexity.
