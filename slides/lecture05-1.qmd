# Lab 2 Instructions

## Monte Carlo for ECS Uncertainty

Your task in the lab: analyze two different games of "chance" (one is, one sort of is). 

Lab is due on 9/22 by 9pm.

## Reminder About The Rubric

For full points, make sure to check rubric (available on the Labs page of the website; Homework is similar) before finalizing submission. If unsure if something might be penalized, please ask on Ed or in class. In general, points will be taken off for:

* Missing units;
* Plots: Unlabeled axes/missing legends if needed;
* Lack of proper precision when reporting values.

# Upcoming Schedule

## Next Classes

**Wednesday**: Monte Carlo wrap-up

**Friday**: Uncertainty and Simple Climate Models

**Next Week**: Prescriptive Modeling and Optimization

## Assessments

**Friday**: Homework 2 and Lab 2 both due.
