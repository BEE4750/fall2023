# Review and Questions

## What Is A System?

A system is an interconnected set of components which "achieve" some function.

## System State

**System State**: quantities or variables which evolve over time based on external inputs and system dynamics.

The state gives you a "snapshot" of the system at a given point in time.

## Stocks and Flows

- A **stock** is the amount of a system property: concentrations of a pollutant, numbers of currency units, etc.
- A **flow** is the way in which a stock changes: decay, diffusion, production, consumption, etc.

## Why Are Systems Interesting?

System interconnections can lead to very different dynamics and outcomes than if the component processes were studied in isolation.

This can have implications for design and management, and means we need to **model the entire system** to understand how different processes impact the whole.

# Modeling Systems

## Systems Analysis Needs

To study a system, we need:

- A **definition** of the system [{{< fa sharp circle-check >}}]{style="color: green"}
- A **model** of the system

plot(x, y, marker=:circle, markersize=10, linewidth=3, xlabel="Time", legend=:false, grid=:x, yticks=:false, yaxis=:false, ylabel="State", gridalpha=1, left_margin=8mm, right_margin=90mm, bottom_margin=10mm, color=:black, guidefontsize=14, tickfontsize=12, x_foreground_color_border=:white)

Random.seed!(12)
x = [0, 1] # hide
y = 3 .+ zeros(2, 8)
y[2, :] .+= (rand(8) * 4) .- 1

## Descriptive vs. Prescriptive Models

### Descriptive Models

- Used primarily for describing or simulating dynamics.
- Intended for *simulations* and *exploratory* and/or *Monte Carlo analysis*.

### Prescriptive Models

- Specify (prescribe) an action, decision, or policy.
- Intended for *optimization* or *decision analysis*.

## Analytic vs. Numerical Solutions

Mathematical models can be solved:

1. **Analytically**: can find the exact solution in closed form;
2. **Numerically**: can only find solutions (exact or approximate) using computational tools.

In general, simple models might be able to be solved analytically, but anything more complex requires numerical methods.

## What Are Models Good For?

## A Leading Question

Someone has developed a model of a complex process (say...number of cases of a particular infectious disease). 

They claim that their model has *precisely* predicted case counts for a few months, and use this to argue that we should use it to predict future case counts.

**Should we trust their claim? What might this imply about the model? Could it be useful?**

# Key Takeaways

## Key Takeaways

- Mathematical models allow us to understand how external inputs combine with internal system dynamics to produce outputs.
- Models can be **prescriptive** or **descriptive** depending on goal of analysis.
- For most interesting problems, cannot solve analytically and need to use numerical methods.

## Key Takeaways

- **Simulation** models: Generate data by evaluating model to represent system dynamics.
- **Optimization** model: Find parameters which maximize/minimize some criterion.

## Key Takeaways

- **All models are at best approximations**: be conscious of what assumptions you've made and how they might change the modeled outcomes (you will be asked to do this on homeworks).
