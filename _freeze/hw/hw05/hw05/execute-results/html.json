Three disposal alternatives are being considered: a landfill (LF), a materials recycling facility (MRF), and a waste-to-energy facility (WTE). The capacities of these facilities and the fees for operation and disposal are provided below.\n\n- **LF**: Capacity 200 Mg, fixed cost \\$2000/day, tipping cost \\$50/Mg;\n- **MRF**: Capacity 350 Mg, fixed cost \\$1500/day, tipping cost \\$7/Mg, recycling cost \\$40/Mg recycled;\n- **WTE**: Capacity 210 Mg, fixed cost \\$2500/day, tipping cost \\$60/Mg;\n\nThe MRF recycling rate is 40%, and the ash fraction of non-recycled waste is 16% and of recycled waste is 14%. Transportation costs are \\$1.5/Mg-km, and the relative distances between the cities and facilities are provided in the table below. \n\n| **City/Facility**  |  **Landfill (km)** | **MRF (km)**  | **WTE (km)** |\n|:-------------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|\n| 1  \t  | 5  | 30 | 15 |\n| 2 \t  | 15 | 25 | 10 |\n| 3       | 13 | 45 | 20 |\n| LF\t  | - | 32  | 18 |\n| MRF\t  | 32 | - | 15 |\n| WTE\t  |  18 | 15 | -  |\n\nThe fixed costs associated with the disposal options are incurred only if the particular disposal option is implemented.  The three cities produce 100, 90, and 120 Mg/day of solid waste, respectively, with the composition provided in the table below. \n\n**Reminder**: Use `round(x; digits=n)` to report values to the appropriate precision!\n\n\n**In this problem**:\n\n* Formulate the waste load allocation problem and implement it in `JuMP`.\n* Draw a diagram showing the flows of waste between the cities and the facilities.  Which facilities (if any) will not be used? Does this solution make sense?\n\n\n::: {.cell .markdown}\n## References\n\nList any external references consulted, including classmates.\n:::\n\n",
