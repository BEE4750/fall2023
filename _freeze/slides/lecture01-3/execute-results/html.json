Once you have created your account, navigate to the [GitHub repository for the assignment](https://github.com/BEE4750/ae01).\n\n2. Click the green \"Code\" button, and copy the URL by clicking on the clipboard icon.\n:::\n::: {.column width=50%}\n![Code Clone Interface on GitHub](images/github-clone.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Clone Repositories: VS Code\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\n\n1. Open a new VS Code window.\n2. Click \"Clone Git Repository\".\n3. Paste the URL you copied from GitHub into the search bar and select the repository, then pick a location to save.\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=50%}\n![VS Code New Window](images/vs-code-clone.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n## Using Local Repositories\n\n1. You will be prompted to open the new folder.\n2. The next step you open VS Code, pick \"Open Folder\" from the initial New Window page.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n### Open Folders, Not Files\nOpening a folder is recommended because it gives you access to a wider set of tools and the version control interface.\n:::\n\n# Jupyter Notebooks\n\n## Notebooks Consist of Cells\n\nJupyter notebooks consist of two cell types:\n\n- \"Text\" cells, which use [Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook) and [LaTeX syntax](https://viveks.me/environmental-systems-analysis/tutorials/latex-notebook.html) for text and math.\n- \"Code\" cells, which contain code which can be evaluated (in this case Julia).\n\n## Notebook Kernels\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=80%}\nYou need to pick a kernel to tell Jupyter what language and version to use for code evaluation. \n\nAfter pressing the kernel selection button (right):\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=20%}\n![Kernel Selection Button](images/kernel-selection.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n1. Select \"Select Another Kernel\".\n2. \"Julia Language Support\"\n3. \"Julia 1.9 Channel\"\n\n## Editing Notebook Cells\n\n1. Double click the text cell at the top of the notebook that includes the \"**Name**:\" and \"**ID**:\" prompts. Add your name and Cornell NetID.\n2. Create a new cell by hovering your cursor over the bottom of a cell. You should see the buttons on the bottom right pop up.\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=75%}\nClick on \"+Code\" or \"+Markdown\" and the new cell should appear.\n:::\n::: {.column width=25%}\n![Create New Cell](images/new-cell.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n# Using GitHub: Committing\n\n## Committing Changes\n\n\"Committing\" is the git term for locking in a particular repository state.\n\n- Once changes are committed, you can restore that version of the files by reverting later changes.\n- Commits are associated with *messages* which briefly describe the change(s) that were made.\n- Commit meaningful changes often and use informative messages!\n\n## VS Code and Git\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=80%}\n\nYou will see the icon on the right on the left-most (vertical) bar. This is the \"Source Control\" icon.\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=20%}\n![VS Code Source Control Icon](images/vscode-github.png)\n:::\n::::\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=70%}\n\nClick this and the \"Explorer\" panel will change to the \"Source Control\" panel.\n\nClick the \"+\" button next to any files you want to commit, add a message, and click \"Commit\".\n:::\n::: {.column width=30%}\n![](images/vscode-source.png){width=80%}\n:::\n::::\n\n## Pushing Changes\n\n\"Pushing\" syncs committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. \n\n- Once commits are pushed, they can be viewed on the repository by anyone with access.\n- Your repositories are all public, so your classmates, the TA, and I can see your code and try to help debug!\n\n## Pushing and VS Code\n\nOnce you've made commits, you will see the following on the bottom of your VS Code window:\n\n:::: {.columns}\n::: {.column width=50%}\n\n- The number by {{< fa arrow-down >}}:  # of remote commits which are not present locally.\n- The number by {{< fa arrow-up >}}: # of local commits which have not been synchronized.\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=50%}\n![VS Code Sync](images/vscode-push.png)\n\n::: {.fragment .fade-in}\nClick the button and VS Code will \"pull\" remote changes and \"push\" local changes.\n:::\n\n:::\n::::\n\n# Exporting Notebooks\n\n## Exporting Your Notebook to PDF\n\nYou'll need to export your notebook to a PDF to submit to Gradescope.\n\nYou should see the following menu bar at the top of the VS Code window:\n![Notebook Menu Bar](images/vs-code-top-bar.png)\n\n## Export Steps\n\n1. Click \"Run All\" to execute all cells in order.\n2. Click the ellipsis (\"...\") and select \"Export\", then click \"HTML\". \n3. Save the file, then when prompted open it (should open in your browser).\n4. Go to the print interface and save as a PDF.\n\n\n# Upcoming Schedule\n\n## Next Classes\n\n**Monday**: Modeling Systems\n\n**Wednesday/Friday**: Examples of Systems Models\n\n",
